## Welcome to the Wonderful World of Data Analysis!

Knowingly or not, you’ve just stepped into an exciting and exceedingly diverse field. Data Analysts collect, organize, study, and present data in order to answer interesting questions and aid in decision making. Just a quick look at the Data is Beautiful subreddit gives you a great idea of some of the interesting projects data analysts work on.

As a data analyst, you’ll have the power to answer your organization's most pressing questions, and present your findings with clear and concise visuals. For this initial project, you’ll step right into a data analyst’s shoes by investigating a raw dataset, and sharing your findings using a Jupyter Notebook. You’ll be working with real data provided by Bay Area Bike Share to determine differences in usage between commuters and tourists ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more!

The steps you take in this project will be taught in more depth throughout the program. By the time you graduate, you’ll be equipped with a diverse set of skills to help you tackle a wide variety of data analysis problems.

Ready? Let’s get started!

## Our Recommendation
By the end of this project, you will be able to identify the key steps of the data analysis process. It’s designed to help you make an informed decision on whether this type of work is interesting to you. As a result, we highly recommend you complete this project in the first 7 days of your Nanodegree program. In addition to your learning, you’ll also understand the submission process and the type of feedback you can expect from your reviewer.

## Getting Started
These next sections will walk you through the steps necessary to get Python up and running on your machine. You'll also get up and running with the Jupyter notebook, which you'll use to complete the project.

### Installing Python
For both this project, and continuing through the program, we’ll use Python to clean and analyze datasets. So before we can get started with the bike share data, you’ll need to install Python on your computer.

We’ll do so using an Anaconda distribution, which comes with many popular Python packages for data analysis, as well as Jupyter Notebook. Some of these packages can be difficult to install otherwise, so we highly recommend installing Anaconda to make life easier. To do so, complete the following:

1. Navigate to http://continuum.io/downloads in your browser.
2. Install Python using the Anaconda distribution, which comes with Jupyter. _Don't install Python 3.4 as the Nanodegree Program uses Python 2.7 throughout the courses and projects._
 * On a PC, click the Windows icon and select "Windows 64-Bit Python 2.7 Graphical Installer". You can also select the 32-bit installer if you have a 32-bit machine. Then run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen.
 * On Mac or Linux, follow the same process but select the appropriate installer for your platform.

### Opening the Jupyter Notebook
As mentioned earlier, you’ll use an Jupyter Notebook to complete this project. When you’re done, you’ll submit an HTML version for feedback, so be sure to log your answers where directed!

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook [here](hhttps://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57bf52d8_dandp0-bikeshareanalysis/dandp0-bikeshareanalysis.zip).
2. Open your Command Prompt (PC) or terminal (Mac or Linux).
 * On a PC click the Start button and search for "Command Prompt".
 * On a Mac type command + spacebar. Then, type "terminal" in the Spotlight Search. You can also search for "terminal" in finder.
3. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Jupyter notebook file.
 * On a PC you might type: cd C:\Users\username\Downloads\, replacing your username. [Learn more about basic terminal commands.](http://www.7tutorials.com/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands)
 * On Mac or Linux you might type: cd ~/Downloads. [Learn more about basic terminal commands.](http://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/utilities-how-to/how-to-use-terminal-the-basics)
4. Run the command `jupyter notebook Data_Analyst_ND_Bikeshare_Project0.ipynb` in your terminal.

## Completing This Project
The Jupyter Notebook has all the information required to submit this project. Read through the notebook, answering questions and running blocks of code when prompted. Remember that if you get stuck or if you have any questions along the way, you can reach out for help on the forums or [schedule a 1-1 appointment with a coach](https://calendly.com/dand-appointments).

When you’ve worked through the entire notebook, come back here to submit!

## Project Submission
Congratulations on completing P0! Now for the moment you’ve been waiting for...time to get feedback from a Udacity Reviewer and see how you did! Let’s just go through a few quick checks to make sure all our i’s are dotted and t’s are crossed.

### Check Your Submission Against the Rubric
We will use [this rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/187/view) to evaluate your project. Take a quick minute to make sure you’ve covered each item in your submission.

Remember that this project is meant to provide you with a quick opportunity to experience the submission process and feedback for your learning. You’re not required to meet specifications on this project, although you are welcome to resubmit until you meet specifications if you like.

When you’re ready, click the blue “Submit Project” button below!

## What Next?
There’s no need to stall your learning while you wait for feedback. You can continue on your learning journey with the next module: Statistics!
